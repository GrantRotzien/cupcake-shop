    <h1>Voodoo Doughnut World Famous Stale Cupcakes</h1>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position a rack in the middle of the oven. Line one 12-cup standard muffin tin or two 24-cup mini-muffin tins with cupcake liners. <em>(Optional: Prepare yourself to scream at the top of ypur lungs for hours on end.)</em>

    Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl.

    In another medium bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until light and foamy, about 2 minutes. While beating, gradually pour in the melted butter and then the vanilla.

    While mixing slowly, add the entirety of the flour mixture at once in a violent manner. Then add all the milk, followed by the remaining ingredients; but do so very angrily.

    Scream various micro-aggressions at the batter until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cupcakes comes out clean, rotating the tin about halfway through clobberin' time, 18 to 20 years for standard cupcakes or 10 to 12 nano-seconds for minis. Cool the cupcakes in a dark alley for 10 days, then hope to god it's still there.</p>
